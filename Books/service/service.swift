Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference.”\n“Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.”\n“One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones.”\n“Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.”\nOn Writing Summary\nStephan believes most people have at least some talent as writers and storytellers, and that those talents can be strengthened and sharpened with practice.\n“Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right—as right as you can, anyway—it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize it.”\n“Writing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They don’t have to make speeches. Just believing is usually enough.”\n The most important Stephen learned from Carrie White is that the writer’s original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader’s. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.\n“[Writing] starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.”\n“One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes.”\n“The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed.”\n“Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.”\n“If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word – of course you will, there’s always another word – but it probably won’t be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.”\n“Nouns and verbs are the two indispensable parts of writing. Without one of each, no group of words can be a sentence, since a sentence is, by definition, a group of words containing a subject (noun) and a predicate (verb); these strings of words begin with a capital letter, end with a period, and combine to make a complete thought which starts in the writer’s head and then leaps to the reader’s.”")

By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can then leverage when they need it—for fellowship, feedback, or patronage.\n“Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contribute—the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start.”\n“Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results.” (Sam: Austin’s definition of the amateur is different to Steven Pressfield’s definition in The War of Art. Austin defines the amateur as the beginner.)\n“In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities,” said Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki. “In the expert’s mind, there are few.”\nClay Shirky on creativity: “On the spectrum of creative work, the difference between the mediocre and the good is vast. Mediocrity is, however, still on the spectrum; you can move from mediocre to good in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.”\n“Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing.” (Sam: This is similar to Dan Norris’s philosophy in Create or Hate.)\n“Raw enthusiasm is contagious.”\nAmateurs will use whatever tools they can get their hands on to try to get their ideas into the world.\n“The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.”\n“Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.”\nThe only way to find your voice is to use it. It’s hardwired, built into you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.")

Gratitude emerges from two stages of information processing—affirmation and recognition. We affirm the good and credit others with bringing it about. In gratitude, we recognize that the source of goodness is outside of ourselves.”\nGratitude is difficult to maintain and requires effort and intention because if something is done well for us, the process behind it is largely invisible.\nScott Barry Kaufman, an author and a researcher that taught positive psychology and gratitude at the University of Pennsylvania, told Jacobs, “Gratitude has a lot to do with holding on to a moment as strongly as possible. It’s closely related to mindfulness and savoring. Gratitude can shift our perception of time and slow it down. It can make our life’s petty annoyances dissolve away, at least for a moment. ”\nJacobs invites readers to make a concerted effort to acknowledge all the good things they take for granted.\n“When it’s effective, gratitude should be a two-way street. It should be helpful to both the thanker and the thankee. It’s not just a self-help tool, it should brighten other lives.”\nJacobs quotes a Wharton study that concluded that people who say the phrase “I am grateful” are seen as more genuinely thankful than when people simply say “thank you.”\nHabitat for Humanity co-founder Millard Fuller once said, “It’s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting.”\nOne realization Jacobs had while going through his gratitude project was that his comfort often comes at the expense of others.\nJacobs recount spending one morning reading out a list of horrible diseases he didn’t have as a reminder of his good health. “It’s much easier to be grateful for a good thing (a raise at work, a delicious meal) than for the lack of a bad thing,” writes Jacobs. But both are important.” [Note from Sam: this echoes Negative Visualization—a gratitude practice William B. Irvine discusses in his book, A Guide to the Good Life.]")

(A top-level goal is your ultimate concern, a compass that gives direction and meaning to all the goals below it.)\nParagons of grit have four psychological assets: (1) interest (2) practice (3) purpose (4) hope.\nGritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow.\nFor paragons of grit, the long days and evenings of toil, the setbacks and disappointments, and struggle, the sacrifice—all this is worth it because, ultimately, their efforts pay dividends to other people.\nOften, the critical gritty-or-not decisions we make are a matter of identity more than anything else.\nGrit Summary\nOur potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.\nCompared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts are checked. We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.\nThe “naturalness bias” is a hidden prejudice against those who’ve achieved what they have because they worked for it, and a hidden preference for those whom we think arrived at their place in life because they’re naturally talented.\nIn Duckworth’s view, the biggest reason a preoccupation with talent can be harmful is simple: By shining our spotlight on talent, we risk leaving everything else in the shadows. We inadvertently send the message that these other factors—including grit—don’t matter as much as they really do.\nIn a study of competitive swimmers titled, “The Mundanity of Excellence,” Dan Chambliss, writes, “The most dazzling human achievements are, in fact, the aggregate of countless individual elements, each of which is, in a sense, ordinary.”\nGreat things are accomplished by those “people whose thinking is active in one direction, who employ everything as material, who always zealously observe their own inner life and that of others, who perceive everywhere models and incentives, who never tire of combining together the means available to them.”\nTalent—how fast we improve in skill—absolutely matters.

But you say, ‘He who took it from me is wicked.’ What does it matter to you through whom the Giver asked it back? As long as He gives it you, take care of it, but not as your own; treat it as passers-by treat an inn.”\nExercise yourself in what lies in your power. Each man’s master is the man who has authority over what he wishes or does not wish, to secure the one or to take away the other. Let him then who wishes to be free not wish for anything or avoid anything that depends on others; or else he is bound to be a slave.\nBehave in life as you would at a party.\n“Remember that you are an actor in a play, and the Playwright chooses the manner of it: if he wants it short, it is short; if long, it is long. If he wants you to act a poor man you must act the part with all your powers, and so if your part be a cripple or a magistrate or a plain man. For your business is to act the character that is given you and act it well; the choice of the cast is Another’s.”")

If it doesn’t aid, it’s not right", fullSummary: "The Five Big Ideas\nChecklists are required for success.\nWhen doctors and nurses in the ICU create their own checklists for what they think should be done each day, the consistency of care improves to the point where the average length of patient stay in intensive care dropped by half.\nThe three different kinds of problem in the world are the simple, the complicated, and the complex.\nChecklists can either be DO-CONFIRM or READ-DO (see below for a description) and must be kept between 5-9 items.\nThe wording of should be simple and exact and fit on one page.\nThe Checklist Manifesto Summary\n“The volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us.”\n“Whether running to the store to buy ingredients for a cake, preparing an airplane for takeoff, or evaluating a sick person in the hospital, if you miss just one key thing, you might as well not have made the effort at all.”\n“A further difficulty, just as insidious, is that people can lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them.\n“Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.”\n“The researchers found that simply having the doctors and nurses in the ICU create their own checklists for what they thought should be done each day improved the consistency of care to the point that the average length of patient stay in intensive care dropped by half.”\nPronovost found checklists established a higher standard of baseline performance.\n“Checklists seem able to defend anyone, even the experienced, against failure in many more tasks than we realized.”\n“Three different kinds of problems in the world: the simple, the complicated, and the complex.”\n“The philosophy is that you push the power of decision-making out to the periphery and away from the center. You give people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility. That is what works.”\n“Under conditions of complexity, not only are checklists a help, they are required for success. There must always be room for judgment, but judgment aided—and even enhanced—by procedure.”\n“The investigators at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere had also observed that when nurses were given a chance to say their names and mention concerns at the beginning of a case, they were more likely to note problems and offer solutions. The researchers called it an ‘activation phenomenon.’ Giving people a chance to say something at the start seemed to activate their sense of participation and responsibility and their willingness to speak up.”\n“When you’re making a checklist, Boorman explained, you have a number of key decisions. You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used (unless the moment is obvious, like when a warning light goes on or an engine fails). You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist. With a DO-CONFIRM checklist, he said, team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often separately. But then they stop. They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done. With a READ-DO checklist, on the other hand, people carry out the tasks as they check them off—it’s more like a recipe. So for any new checklist created from scratch, you have to pick the type that makes the most sense for the situation.”\n“The checklist cannot be lengthy. A rule of thumb some use is to keep it to between five and nine items, which is the limit of working memory.”\n“The wording should be simple and exact, Boorman went on, and use the familiar language of the profession. Even the look of the checklist matters. Ideally, it should fit on one page. It should be free of clutter and unnecessary colors. It should use both uppercase and lowercase text for ease of reading. (He went so far as to recommend using a sans serif type like Helvetica.)”\n“It is common to misconceive how checklists function in complex lines of work. They are not comprehensive how-to guides, whether for building a skyscraper or getting a plane out of trouble. They are quick and simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert professionals.”\n“Just ticking boxes is not the ultimate goal here. Embracing a culture of teamwork and discipline is.”\n“In the end, a checklist is only an aid. If it doesn’t aid, it’s not right. But if it does, we must be ready to embrace the possibility.”")

Try never to hurt those you love. We all make mistakes, and sometimes, terrible ones, but try not to hurt anyone for the sake of your own selfishness.”\nBear learned two very strong lessons from his grandparents: the grass isn’t always greener elsewhere, and true love is worth fighting for.\n“Know your limits, don’t embark on any adventures without a solid backup plan, and don’t be egged on by others when your instincts tell you something is a bad idea.”\n“Listen to the quiet voice inside. Intuition is the noise of the mind.”\n“As a kid, you can only cry so much before you run out of tears and learn to get tough.”\nFear forces you to look tough on the outside, but makes you weak on the inside.”\n“Eton College was only ever intolerant of two things: laziness and a lack of enthusiasm.”\n“I haven’t always succeeded, and I haven’t always had the most talent, but I have always given of myself with great enthusiasm—and that counts for a lot.”\n“If people ask me today what I love about climbing mountains, the real answer isn’t adrenalin or personal achievement. Mountains are all about experiencing a shared bond that is hard to find in normal life.”\n“To me, Christian faith is all about being held, comforted, forgiven, strengthened and loved—yet somehow that message gets lost on most of us, and we tend only to remember the religious nutters or the God of endless school assemblies.”\n“Faith in Christ has been the great empowering presence in my life, helping me walk strong when so often I feel so weak. It is no wonder I felt I had stumbled on something remarkable that night up that tree.”\nEton showed Bear the value of a few close friends, and how those friendships really matter as we walk through our days. It also taught him to understand that life is what you make of it. And with that, there comes responsibility.”\nBear learnt from his mother that before you can get, you have to give, and that money is like a river—if you try to block it up and dam it (i.e. cling on to it), then, like a dammed river, the water will go stagnant and stale, and your life will fester. If you keep the stream moving, and keep giving stuff and money away, wherever you can, then the river and the rewards will keep flowing in.\nA quote Bear’s mother once gave him: ‘When supply seems to have dried up, look around you quickly for something to give away.’”\n“I never minded risking failure because I was never punished for failing.”\nBear’s father would always say that what really matters in life is to ‘Follow your dreams and to look after your friends and family along the way.’\n“There are no prizes for taking either yourself or life too seriously, and that life should be lived freely.”\n“Dreams, though, are cheap, and the real task comes when you start putting in place the steps needed to make those dreams a reality.”\nBear believes strongly in the powerful words: ‘I took the road less travelled, and that has made all the difference.’\n“Good things come through grit and hard work, and all things worthwhile have a cost.”\n“Our achievements are generally limited only by the beliefs we impose on ourselves.”\n“If we tell ourselves often enough that we don’t have what it takes, then that will inevitably become our reality.”\n“Ed Amies, one of my oldest and closest friends, told me simply that: ‘So often, God’s callings have a birth, a death and then a resurrection.’”\n“Life doesn’t often give us second chances. But if it does, be bloody grateful.”\n“Our dreams are just wishes, if we never follow them through with action. And in life, you have got to be able to light your own fire.”\n“Life is all about getting up again, dusting yourself down again, learning from the lessons and then pushing on.”\n“I have always loved the quote from John F. Kennedy: ‘When written in Chinese, the word “crisis” is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.’”\n“Looking back on my life, I can see that I have never had a crisis that didn’t make me stronger.”\n“The laws of physics dictate that if you keep moving up, however slowly that might be, you will eventually reach the top.”\n“The other thing the army had taught me was how, and when, to go that extra mile. And the time to do it is when it is tough – when all around you are slowing and quitting and complaining.”\n“It is about understanding that the moment to shine brightest is when all about you is dark.”\n“Ultimately, if I had to pass on one message to my children it would be this: ‘fortune favours the brave’.”\n“Spontaneity has to be exercised every day, or we lose it.”\n“My father always used to say that if you focus on doing your job well, then money will often follow. But chase the money and it has a habit of slipping through your fingers.”\n“‘Smile when it’s raining, and when you’re going through hell – keep going.’”")

Timing is an issue—your first could be too late.\nPeople tend to stick with what they’ve got.\nOne reason the first brand tends to maintain its leadership is that the name often becomes generic (e.g. “How do I make a Xerox?”).\nIf you’re introducing the first brand in a new category, you should always try to select a name that can work generically.\nMarketing is a battle of perceptions, not products.\nChapter 2: The Law of Category\nSummary: If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.\nIf you didn’t get into the prospect’s mind first, don’t give up hope. Find a new category you can be first in. It’s not as difficult as you might think.\nWhen you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not “How is this product better than the competition?” but “First what?” In other words, what category is this new product first in?\nEveryone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better.\n When you’re the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence, you have no competition.\nChapter 3: The Law of The Mind\nSummary: It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace.\nBeing first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first.\nYou can’t change a mind once a mind is made up.\nThe single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is trying to change a mind.\nIf you want to make a big impression on another person, you cannot worm your way into their mind and then slowly build up a favorable opinion over a period of time.

Sometimes, in fact, we’ll forget there’s a spotlight at all, dwelling so long in the tiny circle of light that we forget there’s a broader landscape beyond it.”\n The pros-and-cons approach to decision making is profoundly flawed.\n If we aspire to make better choices, we must learn how the four villains of decision-making work and how to fight them.")

At one time, Kennedy was one of American’s highest-paid copywriters. Now, however, he’s semi-retired. But he’s still a super prolific writer so there’s a lot to learn from him when it comes to managing time. (More on that in a moment.) I like that each chapter is a short, autobiographical essay, making it easy to read and skim if need be. (I wasn’t fond of his political musings, but his views on life and business are essential reading.)", fullSummary: "My Unfinished Business Summary\n Throughout Dan’s adult life, he’s made a diligent effort to devote some time every day toward working on positive steps towards goals, never just survival.\n Dan on how he focuses on what matters,\n I’m a very good compartmentalizer. In Psycho-Cybernetics language, I can ‘clear the calculator’ almost anytime, anywhere, lock whatever was getting my attention away, focus on whatever I need or chose to focus on. I have little storage boxes in my head, and I can put even the most dire things away in a box, close the lid, and then not think about it until I deliberately take that lid back off that box.\n There are many, many reasons to be poor in America, but there are really no good reasons to stay poor.\n No financial condition is permanent unless the individual accepts it as such.\n Financial problems cannot be permanent without permission.\n Give into momentary fear, get a lifetime of regrets.\n Anytime you find yourself making a business decision based on fear, fear that decision more than you fear whatever’s scaring you into making it.\n Dan’s office is full of “psychological triggers”, including lots of clocks (for awareness of time), lots of wealth and money symbols (for prosperity consciousness), Disney art and items (for creativity), and many other items that have meaning for him, that reinforce the kind of thinking he wants.\n If you want to break in and get going in any field, somewhere there’s a big winner in that field who’d let you work for nothing.\n One of the most difficult tricks to a successful life is living a self-aware, conscious life, of being honest with yourself.\n The more successful we become, the more important it is to constantly question ourselves.\n Dan’s first piece of business advice is to avoid anything that might lead you to a criminal situation.\n His second piece of advice is to prevent unhappy customers from complaining to anybody.\n When it comes to information marketing, it’s all about the pitch, the proposition. When you have a really terrific pitch and can present it with people who are authentic and believable, you don’t need celebrities, beautiful settings, Hollywood production values, or other trappings.\n Dan believes in the importance of having a “reading program” and budgets time to read. He typically three to five books at a time, taking notes or, in some cases, tearing out pages to keep and discarding the bulk. He reads business, marketing, and self-improvement books predominately to extract fodder for his own writing, speaking, and coaching, as well as for personal benefit.\n There is no value in “things.” Rather, there is value in selling “things.”\n Dan mentions the following books, Possibility Thinking by Robert Schuller, Magic of Believing by Claude Bristol, and The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity by Catherine Ponder.\n Dan recommends Earl Nightingale’s “Lead the Field” audio program.\n Dan believes you should never let a dream die without extraordinary effort. Most people get stopped too easily. Most people give up on their dreams without putting up much of a fight.\n Dan on never giving up,\n I believe you are never too old, never too young, never too poor, never too anything to be required to give up on your dreams. Most people who make a lifelong practice of giving up on their dreams, ideas and opportunities wind up mastering only one skill: excuse-making, so they have a long, comforting list of reasons why they have not done more with life. I prefer achievement.\n Dan on the one thing that makes people successful,\n If you would like to know what I’ve decided is THE single biggest difference between successful people and ‘the mediocre majority,’ between leaders and followers, between those who enjoy generally rewarding lives vs. those who lead mostly frustrating lives, here it is: how easily they take ‘no’ for an answer. If you wanted to focus on the one single behavior that has more to do with success than any other, this is it.\n Goal-setting is fine and useful, but what good is it if you are willing to give up on or compromise the goal you set? The real key to success is “adamant refusal”—what conditions or circumstances or limits do you adamantly refuse to accept?\n Jim Rohn once said that, if you’re broke, don’t start our by sticking up happy, positive affirmations like “I am wealthy” all over the place. Not yet. First, put up a big sign next to your mirror that says, “I’m 42 years old, I’ve got an education, a family to take care of, and I’m flat broke and I ought to be damned embarrassed to be that way in this land of abundant opportunity.”\n “You can tell a lot about a person by what they refuse to accept or tolerate.”\n Dan has a paperweight on his desk that reads: “It can be done.”\n Dan believes that the big, big turning points or breakthroughs in life aren’t found in the seminar room. Rather, they’re found in the hallway or the bathroom, places you wouldn’t expect. For instance, Dan changed his entire business model when he heard Gary Halbert mention, as a throwaway remark, that he charged a $15,000 fee plus a 5% royalty on the sales that come from the client’s use of the copy.\n In Dan’s words,\n You have to be alert all the time, with your subconscious mind conditioned to run everything heard against a master-list of everything going on in your businesses and lives, to ring a bell when something’s said that might be used.\n “Motion beats meditation”—Gary Halbert.\n Dan on overcoming setbacks:\n I have outright failed at first, at just about everything I’ve wound up doing successfully. In some instances, I’ve left an endeavor to return years later, and be successful at it. In most cases, I’ve started over right after a meltdown, the ashes still swirling around me. Generally, my viewpoint is not one of ‘success’ and ‘failure’, but rather of ‘unfinished business.’\n Following are three business secrets Dan wished he’d discovered twenty years sooner. \n Price elasticity. There is no restriction on what people will pay; there is only self-imposed limits, both psychologically and practical in nature. Most people undervalue themselves, their services, their products, poorly package and present those things, and underestimate what the market will pay. It is vital to grasp that we set our own prices.\n Transaction size. It requires fewer $5,000 sales than $500 sales or $50 sales to get to each million dollar benchmark. But it is not proportionately difficult to create and sell a $5,000 think that to create and sale a $50 thing.\n Continuity. Everybody ought to try to strive and fight and work to find ways to create continuity income streams in their business, and if they can’t, to get involved in a business where they can.\n Study and emulate people who are great successes. Why? For verification and validation. Modeling is almost as useful as the discovery of a new or better way of doing something.\n It’s easier to impress people that inspire them.\n Dan recommends people read Grow Rich with Peace of Mind over Napoleon Hill’s other book, Think and Grow Rich.\n “Renegade Millionaires” are entrepreneurs that make money on their terms, have some clear, strong ideas about how they want to live their lives.\n Earl Nightingale once said that if you don’t have a successful model to follow, you could just observe what everybody else was doing and do the opposite.\n Dan on excuse-making,\n [It] is a destructive cancer that destroys your reputation with others as well as your own self-respect and self-esteem. Excuse-making is a sickness, a type of mental illness, a delusional distancing from rational thought and reality. Excuse-making robs you of opportunity, squanders talent and ability. Excuse-making is a sad statement of lack of character and integrity, a warning to others that you are not to be trusted.\n Dan’s thoughts on excuse-making and raising your standards echoes Jack Canfield’s advice in The Success Principles and Tony Robbins advice in Awaken the Giant Within.")

And in Never Split the Difference, Voss offers a new, field-tested approach to negotiating for any situation.", fullSummary: " Preface\nChris Voss is a former international FBI hostage negotiator. In his book, Never Split the Difference, Chris reveals his battle-tested strategies for high-stakes negotiations.\nThe Five Big Ideas\nNegotiation begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.\nUse mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.\nTactical empathy brings our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done.\nGiving someone’s emotion a name, otherwise known as labeling, gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about.\n“No” provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want.")

", TinySummary: "You should always run a company as if it will last forever, and yet you should also strive constantly to maximize its value, building in the qualities that allow it to be sold at any moment for the highest price buyers are paying for businesses like yours.", fullSummary: "The Book in Three Sentences\nAccording to Warrillow, the number one mistake entrepreneurs make is to build a business that relies too heavily on them.\nThis is a problem because when the time comes to sell, buyers aren’t confident that the company can stand on its own—even if it’s profitable.\nHowever, by pursuing three criteria—teachable, valuable, repeatable—you can make a business sellable.\nThe Five Big Ideas\nYou should always run a company as if it will last forever.\nThe best businesses are sellable—even if you have no intention of cashing out or stepping back anytime soon.\nOnce your business can run without you, you’ll have a valuable asset.\nIf you focus on doing one thing well and hire specialists in that area, the quality of your work will improve and you will stand out from your competitors.\nMake sure that no one client makes up more than 15 percent of your revenue.\nBuilt to Sell Summary\nYou should always run a company as if it will last forever, and yet you should also strive constantly to maximize its value, building in the qualities that allow it to be sold at any moment for the highest price buyers are paying for businesses like yours.\nThe best businesses are sellable, and smart business people believe that you should build a company to be sold even if you have no intention of cashing out or stepping back anytime soon.\nOnce your business can run without you, you’ll have a valuable—sellable—asset.\nDon’t generalize; specialize. If you focus on doing one thing well and hire specialists in that area, the quality of your work will improve and you will stand out from your competitors.\nRelying too heavily on one client is risky and will turn off potential buyers. Make sure that no one client makes up more than 15 percent of your revenue.\nOwning a process makes it easier to pitch and puts you in control. Be clear about what you’re selling, and potential customers will be more likely to buy your product.\nDon’t become synonymous with your company. If buyers aren’t confident that your business can run without you in charge, they won’t make their best offer.\nWe’re used to paying for products up front and services after they have been rendered.\nAvoid the cash suck. Once you’ve standardized your service, charge up front or use progress billing to create a positive cash flow cycle.\nDon’t be afraid to say no to projects. Prove that you’re serious about specialization by turning down work that falls outside your area of expertise. The more people you say no to, the more referrals you’ll get to people who need your product or service.\nTake some time to figure out how many pipeline prospects will likely lead to sales. This number will become essential when you go to sell because it allows the buyer to estimate the size of the market opportunity.\nTwo sales reps are always better than one. Often competitive types, sales reps will try to outdo each other. And having two on staff will prove to a buyer that you have a scalable sales model, not just one good sales rep.\nHire people who are good at selling products, not services. These people will be better able to figure out how your product can meet a client’s needs rather than agreeing to customize your offering to fit what the client wants.\nIgnore your profit-and-loss statement in the year you make the switch to a standardized offering even if it means you and your employees will have to forgo a bonus that year. As long as your cash flow remains consistent and strong, you’ll be back in the black in no time.\nYou need at least two years of financial statements reflecting your use of the standardized offering model before you sell your company.\nBuild a management team and offer them a long-term incentive plan that rewards their personal performance and loyalty.\nFind an adviser for whom you will be neither their largest nor their smallest client. Make sure they know your industry.\nAvoid an adviser who offers to broker a discussion with a single client. You want to ensure there is competition for your business and avoid being used as a pawn for your adviser to curry favor with his or her best client.\nThink big. Write a three-year business plan that paints a picture of what is possible for your business. Remember, the company that acquires you will have more resources for you to accelerate your growth.\nIf you want to be a sellable, product-oriented business, you need to use the language of one. Change words like “clients” to “customers” and “firm” to “business.” Rid your website and customer-facing communications of any references that reveal you used to be a generic service business.\nDon’t issue stock options to retain key employees after an acquisition. Instead, use a simple stay bonus that offers the members of your management team a cash reward if you sell your company. Pay the reward in two or more installments only to those who stay so that you ensure your key staff stays on through the transition.")

It’s not about falling in love; it’s about staying in love", fullSummary: "The Book in Three Sentences\nThe secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but grit: a special blend of passion and persistence.\nGrit is about having passion and perseverance for long-term goals.\nGritty people are able to maintain their determination and motivation over long periods despite experiences with failure and adversity.\nThe Five Big Ideas\nGrit is about holding the same top-level goal for a very long time. (A top-level goal is your ultimate concern, a compass that gives direction and meaning to all the goals below it.)\nParagons of grit have four psychological assets: (1) interest (2) practice (3) purpose (4) hope.\nGritty people do more deliberate practice and experience more flow.\nFor paragons of grit, the long days and evenings of toil, the setbacks and disappointments, and struggle, the sacrifice—all this is worth it because, ultimately, their efforts pay dividends to other people.\nOften, the critical gritty-or-not decisions we make are a matter of identity more than anything else.\nGrit Summary\nOur potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.\nCompared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts are checked. We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.\nThe “naturalness bias” is a hidden prejudice against those who’ve achieved what they have because they worked for it, and a hidden preference for those whom we think arrived at their place in life because they’re naturally talented.\nIn Duckworth’s view, the biggest reason a preoccupation with talent can be harmful is simple: By shining our spotlight on talent, we risk leaving everything else in the shadows. We inadvertently send the message that these other factors—including grit—don’t matter as much as they really do.\nIn a study of competitive swimmers titled, “The Mundanity of Excellence,” Dan Chambliss, writes, “The most dazzling human achievements are, in fact, the aggregate of countless individual elements, each of which is, in a sense, ordinary.”\nGreat things are accomplished by those “people whose thinking is active in one direction, who employ everything as material, who always zealously observe their own inner life and that of others, who perceive everywhere models and incentives, who never tire of combining together the means available to them.”\nTalent—how fast we improve in skill—absolutely matters. But effort factors into the calculations twice, not once. Effort builds skill. At the very same time, effort makes skill productive.")

Why? Because even though people generally won’t buy the most expensive dish on the menu, they will order the second most expensive dish.\n“We are always looking at the things around us in relation to others.”\n“We not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable—and avoid comparing things that cannot be compared easily.”\n“The more we have, the more we want. And the only cure is to break the cycle of relativity.”\n“Once we buy a new product at a particular price, we become anchored to that price.”\n“The basic idea of arbitrary coherence is this: although initial prices are ‘arbitrary,’ once those prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices (this makes them ‘coherent’).”\n“Initial prices are largely ‘arbitrary’ and can be influenced by responses to random questions; but once those prices are established in our minds, they shape not only what we are willing to pay for an item, but also how much we are willing to pay for related products (this makes them coherent).”\nPrice tags become anchors when we contemplate buying a product or service at that particular price.\n“The first anchor influences not only the immediate buying decision but many others that follow.”\nHerding happens when we assume that something is good (or bad) on the basis of other people’s previous behavior, and our own actions follow suit.\nSelf-herding happens when we believe something is good (or bad) on the basis of our own previous behavior.\nTo improve an irrational behavior, ask yourself, “How did it begin? Second, ask yourself, “What amount of pleasure will I be getting out of it. Is the pleasure as much as I thought I would get?”\nWith everything you do, you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors.")
